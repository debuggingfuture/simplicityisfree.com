##### 2016 - Present (consultant-based)

[SLEEEP](https://sleeep.io) is a capsule hotel in Central, Hong Kong. It is a space for people to recharge in this city that never sleeps.
Being the Tech Guy, my work is to make technologies creating the experience, replacing friction with warmth. [Booking app - EXP](https://exp.sleeep.io) to reserve your next sleeping timeslot right away. QR Code as key to entry, with your SLPer(capsule) & locker then welcoming you with blinks. Slowly glowing light as alarm to adjust you from your sleep cycles. The company behind, [spaceis.ltd](https://spaceis.ltd) also inspired this domain's.

*Angular/Node/Postgres for Webapp, AWS Lambda/Node/Philips Hue/Raspberry Pi for IoT*
