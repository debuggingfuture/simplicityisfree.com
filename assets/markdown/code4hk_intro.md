# CODE4HK
##### 2013

Base on the simple idea of [do something for my city using my expertise](http://blog.code4.hk/hackathon/2013/12/01/code-for-hk), I cofounded CODE4HK the civic hacking community in Hong Kong, importing the ideas from g0v.tw or Code for America. We organized meet up, hackathons and initiated different projects. [here](http://blog.code4.hk/) shows some of the work of the community. My reflections can be found at this [short write-up](https://www.facebook.com/groups/code4hk/permalink/1148053448595853/)
