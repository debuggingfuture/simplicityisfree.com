# Software Architect, OneSky
##### 2014 - Present
As an Engineer there my job is to translate code into a world class online localization platform. Enjoyed growing in this startup and touching everywhere from devops, application, data analysis, frontend to growth, with clients all over the world.

- Work with designers to strive for best UX and microinteractions on modular web app built with AngularJS, gulp, ES6 and webpack.

- Build out End-to-end data analysis pipeline using Scrapy/Spark/Cassandra/Airflow riding on Kubernetes and hack on languages with ElasticSearch and jieba

- Architecting solutions and migrate systems from monolithic to event-driven microservices architecture, as in [Our stack, from Monolithic/PHP to Microservices/Scala](https://medium.com/translate-engineer-error/our-stack-from-monolithic-php-to-microservices-scala-a7950266c4be)

- Work with growth/product team and promote the Data-Driven culture by setting up metrics dashboard and analysis to align team growth goals and keep track of system heartbeats. From Customer journey modelling/prediction, UI Behaviour tracking, to Real User Monitoring.

This job also makes me reflect & practice a lot for my career goal - building Better Peopleware, from structuring the team based on Spotify-like agile methodology to ensuring systematic process for knowledge management and coding standards adoption, where I wrote on ["How our Engineering team work as a Learning Organization"](https://medium.com/translate-engineer-error/how-our-engineering-team-work-as-a-learning-organization-92aae2fbd26f) with presentation at [Agile HK 2016](http://slides.com/chunyinvincentlau/learning-org#/) , among [others](https://medium.com/translate-engineer-error)
