### Domain
- Content vs Info
  - a piece of thing
    - markdown
    - fb
    - medium

### Drawbacks
- need explicit handle for photos in markdown...

### TODO scoped CSS

### TODO separate key vs title, as key is not capatialized

### pbm
- defined key but no content? even file there
- type of content a bit complicated & overlap (card concept)

- key: kebab, title: keep as is
